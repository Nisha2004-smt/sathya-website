    <p>A paragraph is a unit of writing composed of one or more sentences that centers on a single, coherent idea or topic, serving to organize writing and enhance readability. Paragraphs typically begin with an indentation or a line break to signal the start of a new thought. They can vary in length, but they generally contain a topic sentence that introduces the main idea, followed by supporting sentences that elaborate on that idea with details, examples, or explanations. Effective paragraphs help to structure essays, articles, and other written works, making it easier for readers to follow the author's argument or narrative.</p>
